## QuoteBotTelegram
A personnal project about a bot to save quotes rather then storing in your personnal conversations Forwared messages.

# Libraries used :
- Akka for actors
- https://github.com/mukel/telegrambot4s a wrapper for the telegram bot 

# What is the purpose of this project ?
From time to time in my Telegram experience, I've had problem storing and remembering forwared message to quote my friends on certain topic and we would sometime just quote ourselves out of context. 
Problem is, this behavior would completely fill out my conversation with myself as it had the purpose of a message storage facility, so I've decided to create this bot to solve this problem at once.

# Features intended at the end :
- Personnal experience : Each user would store its own messages and can query them explicitly
- Many way of search : Through tags, names, username, randomly... I want it to be as useful as possible
- The ability to randomly seek messages stored by anybody
